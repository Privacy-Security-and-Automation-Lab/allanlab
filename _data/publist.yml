#- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"
#  image: Pairs3.png
#  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

  description: Using the incitements or calls to harassment posted by members of these communities as a lens through which to holistically measure and understand this ecosystem. We create a filtering pipeline to discover 14,679 incitements to harassment within four large-scale data sets of messages and posts that span multiple platforms.
